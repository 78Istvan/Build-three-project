# GymTea
## Gym Project

This project was made for a gym called [GymTea]( https://78istvan.github.io/Build-three-project/).

The name is short and very easy to remember for it, so any time people are looking for a gym or talking about exercises in the location where the gym is, they will remember the short and easy name.

The website is designed to be responsive on most of the devices to give the best user experience to the gym customers and users.

## User experience(UX)

### First time users

* First Time Visitors can see an image what tells them the profile of the page.

* First Time Visitors can easily navigate on the webpage to find essential information about a gym just like classes, prices, contact, and location.

* First Time Visitors want to check their social media links to find out how popular and trustable the gym. They can see the number of followers, comments, good or bad feed backs, if they are following the gym social life.

### Returning users

* Returning Users can renew their membership using the sign up form.

* Returning Users can follow the time table about their classes.

* Returning Users can enjoy the gym community to visit the gym gallery page regularly.

## Design 

* Black and white colours have been used to make a big contrast with a little orange to make a little different, and highlight some text.

* The Nato Sans JP font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.
 
* Home page image is an energetic strong image in the middle of the page to tell any visitor what is the main profile of the website.
