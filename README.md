# GymTea
## Gym Project

This project was made for a gym called [GymTea]( https://78istvan.github.io/Build-three-project/).

The name is short and very easy to remember for it, so any time people are looking for a gym or talking about exercises in the location where the gym is, they will remember the short and easy name.

The website is designed to be responsive on most of the devices to give the best user experience to the gym customers and users.

## User experience(UX)

## Design 

* Black and white colours have been used to make a big contrast with a little orange to make a little different and highlight some text.

* The Nato Sans JP font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font is not being imported into the site correctly.
 
* Home page image is an energetic strong image in the middle of the page to tell the visitor what is the main profile of the website.

* Allof the pages are very clear without any confusing content. Every page contains only the title of the page with all the necesary information. 

* The aim is to give the most information, wrapped in an elegant design.

## Wireframes

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Navbar buttons:

* The navigation buttons allowed the user to switch between the pages. The buttons have hover effect so when the cursor is above the button, the button gets an under line decoration. The navbar is on the very top of the page wich turn to a scroll down menu on small device.
The menubar is fixed to the top to make an easer usage when the page scrolled down especially on small screens.

2. Social icons:

* When social icons are clicked, the browser takes the user to the linked social platform. The social icons code has the 'noreferrel' code to the site security.

3. Sign up form testing:

* The classes page has a signup form wich helps the user to join to a class. The classes table is placed above the form so the user can see what are the available options about the classes and sign up then to the choosen class on the same page.
Sign up form has placeholders to make easer to fill them up, and gives a little warning to fill up the form with the correct information, don't leave it blank.

4. Images responsiveness testing:

* The used images are not streched or pixeld on large or small screen eather. They are appear on the right size and they make the site more attractive. Contact page middle section image has benn edited to fit in the middle on small screen.
### Website responsiveness testing

* To test my website to how responsive I used my own devices {Iphone8, Ipad6 10" ,IMacAir 13", Dell laptop 15"} firstly.

* Secondly, I used two other free software

* [Responsinator](https://www.responsinator.com)
                                    
* [Responsive Website Design Tester](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/#home)

### Validator Testing
